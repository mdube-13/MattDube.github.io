    The future of the Celtics looks bright, especially for the next few years. 
    With Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown both in, or entering the prime of their careers, coupled with a young and talented bench, the Celtics should be a problem for the res tof the league for years to come. 
    In last year's draft, the Celtics selected Baylor Scheierman, a 6'6 forward from Creighton, who has shown a lot of potential, especially in his shooting ability so far in the time he has played.
    If Brad Stevens, the Celtics General Manager, can, when the time comes, find good trade value from the aging players on the roster like Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, and even Kristaps Porzingis, especially if Brad can find a way to get draft picks in said trades, the Celtics future looks even brighter.

    While the Celtics still have a few years left with the key players currently on the roster, it's never too early to plan for the future, especially in the NBA. 
    If the Celtics can secure young talent in the upcoming years, coupled with the ability for well-known and talented vets, who are willing to take a salary cut to have the chance to win a title with the Celtics.\
    Alongside the already established young All-NBA talent in Tatum and Brown, the Celtics may become the leagues next "Superteam."
    But, what it really all comes down to is going to be the ability for the Celtics stars and key players, such as Tatum and Brown to stay healthy so that they can extend the longevity of their careers.
    Without key leaders and stars staying healthy, it is hard for a team to get into a winning rhythm.
    An example of this will be on display upon the return of Kristaps Porzingis to the team later on this season. 
    This will give us a good look at how the team responds chemisty and rhythm wise to a player who has been injured.

    Although, as the pay for star players in the league rises, making it harder to surround your stars with talent good enough to make up for the increase in pay, draft picks, and draft contracts have become much more valuable.
    In particular, second round draft picks' value has especially increased, this is due to the low salary rookie contracts, especially for those player selected in the second round.
    This allows teams to draft high-level, NBA ready players who may have stayed at the collegiate level until their junior or senior year, but have enough basketball experinece to come in and make an instant impact on the team.
    One good thing that has come out of the NIL deals at the collegiate level, is that more players are staying in school longer, allowing them to developing and hone their skills, as well as real, in-game experience against people of similar talent.
