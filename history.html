    Above we see an image of three of the greatest players to ever wear a Celtics uniform. 
    On the left we have Paul Pierce, who led the 2008 Celtics to a Finals Championship.
    In the middle is Larry "Legend" Bird, arguably the greatest Celtics player, and one of the overall greatest players to ever touch a basketball.
    He led the Celtics to Finals Victories in 1981, 1984, and 1986, where they had to go up again the 80's Lakers, one of the toughest teams we've ever seen. 
    Last but not definelty not least, on the right we have Bill Russell who has ELEVEN, yes you read that right ELEVEN NBA Titles, which is the most in NBA history, and is a record we may never see be broken. 
    He led the team as not just a player, but in 1968 and 1969 he led the team to finals victory as the starting center and the head coach. 
    Yes, he also was the head coach of the Celtics while he was still a player, we haven't, and won't ever see something like that again. 
</p>

    The Celtics have had a long history of being a winning team, I mean, after all, the Celtics as an organization do have the most NBA titles ever.
    But, with those victories came some losses, namely in the deaths of both number 2 draft pick Len Bias, and All-Star Reggie Lewis, who would have kept the 80's Celtics reign of terror going into the 90's.
    These two, combined would have gave  the legendary, and GOAT, Michael Jordan in his early years a tough time in the Eastern Confrence.
    Both of these two were young, incredibly talented, and very coachable, who were both ready to learn from the 80's legends, McKale, Bird, and Parish just how to win games and stay consistent.
    Sadly, the late 80's early 90's was when cocaine was a drug of chocie for many americans, and at that time, many professional athletes.
    While Reggie died from cardiac arrest, his heart defects were most definetly increased by his use of cocaine.
    As for Len, he saldy died of a cocaine overdose just two days after he was drafted by the Celtics. 
    Both of these men were ferocious finishers at the rim, both with an incredible work ethic, who brought intensity to their opponents on both ends of the floor. 
    Not to mention they both shot the ball well, especially for their size.
    Sometimes in life, we will find ourselves sitting back and imagining "what could have been."
    Well, this is one of those moments, just thinking about what the Celtics could have been with both Len Bias and Reggie Lewis coupled with an aging Larry Bird, just how much damage they would ahve done to the rest of the NBA.
    But, sadly, all we can do when it comes to the should-have-been greatness of Lewis and Bias, is sit back and imagine.

    While the Celtics have had their lows, they have also had an incredible amount of ups, starting with the man who started out the winning "sickness" in Boston, Bill Russell.
    Russell was a 6'11 center who was an all around amazing basketball player, coupled with the legendary Bob Cousy, John Havelicek, and the Jones', K.C and Sam. 
    It made for a combination that just proved to be an absolute unstoppable force in the early days of the NBA.
    I mean, after all, they did will ELEVEN Titles, which is a record which will undoubtedly never be broken. 
    Many may sa that the competition in the age of Russel was awful, but he matched up against a multitude of future NBA Hall-of-Fame faces.
    Such as the great Wilt Chamberlain, who holds the NBA record for points in a signel game at 100. 
    As well as Jerry West, aka the logoman, Elgin Baylor, Richie Guerin, Hal Greer, Oscar Robertson, and the list goes on.
    This team, led by Bill Russel is a team that has, and forever will be, one of the greatest teams in NBA history. 
    Below is a link to Bill Russell's career stats if you would like to see just how great he really was.

    After the reign of the Russell-led Celtics, we saw a new face emerge as the next face of Boston basketball. 
    This face would be one of a man by the name of Larry Bird, who was from French Lick, Indiana, otherwise known as the middle of nowhere. 
    Although Larry might not have grown up around some of the best stars, he sure faced them, both in college and in the NBA, he would be going head-to-head against the great Magic Johnson, who is known as one of, if not the best Point Gaurd in NBA history.
    In his Prime, Larry won a very respectable 3 titles, but this was the age when the rivalry of the Lakers and the Celtics would begin, and which still exists to this day as one the greatest rivalries in sports history. 
    Bird and Magic soon become the faces of the NBA, and while the Lakers were star studded with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, and many others, so were the Celtics.
    During this time, Larry would be paired alongside 3 other futire Hall of Fame players, those players being Bill Walton, Kevin McKale, and Robert Parish, all of which were hard-nosed, tuff, and above all incredibly talented players.
    While this team might not have won as many titles as they could ahve, they still go down in hostory as one of the greatest teams ever, led by one of the greatest players ever, Larry Bird. 
    Below is a link to the career stats of Larry Bird, incase you would like a deeper look into his outstanding career.
    Below that is a video of some of the top plays of Bird from his career.

    Sadly, after the Celtics Championship win in 1986, the Celtics would go on a "Title-Drought" for the next 22 years.
    That is until the Celtics assembled another totally star-studded team to compete against, and eventually beat the Lakers led by the great Kobe Bryant partnered alongside Pau Gasol.
    This team the celtics assembled consisted of a "BIG-3" for the ages, led by Paul Pierce, a ferocious 2-way player who had an incredible niche for shooting a basketball, as well as a skillset molded perfectly to fit in as the leader of the 2008 Celtics.
    The Celtics management meant business when the traded for MVP Kevin Garnett, who was an absolute beast on both ends of the floor.
    He was absolutely ferocious, trying his best to destory the rim everytime he went up to dunk, and trying to destory the ball everytime someone took a shot against him.
    Not to mention, he came with a special plus, he was, and is the greatest trash talker to ever step on an NBA floor. 
    But, the man who wrapped it all together was the great Ray Allen, who would go on to ave LeBron's career with his infamous corner three against the Spurs.
    Ray Allen is one of the best shooters to ever play the game of basketball, he had incredible range from the 3-point line, as well as a killer midrange, packaged with incredible athleticism which allowed him to be great both finishing at the rim and stopping quick gaurds from making a big difference. 
    On top of that, the man who made the magic happened, who got the ball where it needed to be, exactly when it needed to be, Rajon Rondo.
    Rondo being only his second NBA season was the key player on the 2008 Celtics roster, with great court vision, beautful passing skills, and on top of that his next-level defense and quickness, he made for the perfect "cheery-on-top" if you will, for the '08 Celtics.
    All together, this combination of players made ofr a Championship team, who after a 22-year drought, finally brought an NBA title back home to Boston. 
    Below you can find some highlights from that seaosn, which beautifuly showcases the talent and chemistry this team had on both ends of the floor.
